# Simple_Linear_Regression
> Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example.Regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model and analyze the relationships between variables.
>
> It is primarily used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. Regression helps in understanding how the dependent variable changes when one or more independent variables are varied.
> If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Types of Regression iclude:
> + Simple Linear Regression
> + Simple Linear Regression
> + Multiple Linear Regression
> + Polynomial Regression
> + Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
> + Decision Tree Regression
> + Random Forest Regression

## Simple Linear Regression
Models a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
### Formula:  𝑦 =b0 + b1𝑥1 _where y is the dependent variable, X1 is the independent variable, b0 is the y-intercept (constant) and b1 is the slope coefficient_

### Example: Assumming we are Predicting house prices based on square footage, the fomula will look like this:
house_prices = b0 +b1Xsquare_footage
